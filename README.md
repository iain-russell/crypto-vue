## About CoinSushi
  CoinSushi is a single page application built using Vue.js, Bulma, and
  Buefy. Like me, it has no style.

  It uses two APIs, CoinGecko and Coinpaprika. The charts on
  the site are built using ApexCharts.

  CoinSushi is hosted
  on an AWS EC2 server. It is deployed using Docker and Nginx.
